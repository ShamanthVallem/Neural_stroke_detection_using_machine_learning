# Neural_stroke_detection_using_machine_learning

Project title: Stroke price Prediction

How to run this project:
1)Download the files(code and dataset) into same folder.
2)Then open jupyter from that folder
3)Then in jupyter, open the file named 'stroke_prediction_code.ipynb'
4)Then run the code

Note: 
1) Please make sure the code and dataset are in the same folder.
2) in case while adding the data set using pandas inside the code, if an errors are occured(which will not happen 99%)
 You can follow this link to download the data set and then replace the downloaded dataset with this new one and run the code.
